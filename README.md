# N-Body-Gravity-Simulation
Final Project for Introduction to Computational Physics. Uses a particle mesh method to solve Poisson's equation for graviational potential and solves the resulting system of Newtonian equations with Verlet Integration.
## Requirements
Python 3
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
## Usage
```
python Simulator.py
```
## Example Output
As output varies based on matplotlib viewer, a representative image of the results for a spherical mass distribution has been provided.
